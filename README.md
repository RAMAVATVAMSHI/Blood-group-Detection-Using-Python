# Blood-group-Detection-using-python

Project Title
Blood Group Detection Using Image Processing in Python

Description
This project aims to detect blood groups using image processing techniques. It utilizes various image processing libraries in Python to analyze images of blood samples and determine the blood group based on the reactions observed with different reagents.

Features
Image Processing: Utilizes libraries such as OpenCV and scikit-image for image manipulation and analysis.
User Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for user interaction.
Multiple Processing Stages: The application processes images through several stages, including:
Green Plane Extraction
Auto Thresholding
Adaptive Thresholding
Morphological Operations
Histogram Analysis
Blood Group Determination: Automatically determines the blood group based on the processed images.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Required libraries:
OpenCV
scikit-image
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pillow (PIL)
Tkinter (included with Python)
